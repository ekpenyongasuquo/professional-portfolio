<h1>Ethical Dilemma Analysis</h1>

<p>
During my academic experience, I encountered an ethical dilemma involving
the handling of sensitive system access credentials during a technical project.
A peer suggested sharing login credentials to save time and complete the task faster.
</p>

<p>
While this approach appeared efficient, it violated basic cybersecurity principles,
institutional policies, and professional ethics. Sharing credentials increases the risk
of unauthorized access, data breaches, and accountability issues.
</p>

<p>
I chose to follow ethical and professional standards by refusing to share credentials
and instead encouraged proper access controls and documentation. This decision
reinforced the importance of integrity, responsibility, and adherence to security policies.
</p>

<p>
From this experience, I learned that ethical decision-making often requires courage
and patience. Upholding professional standards protects not only systems and data,
but also trust, reputation, and long-term success in the IT field.
