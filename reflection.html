<h1>Reflective Activity</h1>

<p>
I set aside time for quiet reflection to ponder my spiritual journey,
temple covenants, and the direction of my personal and professional growth.
This experience allowed me to slow down, disconnect from distractions,
and focus on peace, gratitude, and purpose.
</p>

<p>
As I reflected, I recognized how deeply my spiritual values influence
my professional goals. Integrity, discipline, and service are not separate
from my career development—they guide how I learn, work, and lead.
</p>

<p>
Elder Bednar’s analogy of intertwined strands resonated with me,
illustrating how spiritual and professional growth strengthen each other.
When I prioritize spiritual alignment, my motivation, clarity,
and ethical awareness improve in my academic and technical work.

<p>
This reflective experience reaffirmed my commitment to becoming
a capable IT professional who relies on the Lord, serves others,
and uses technical skills to bless my family and community.
